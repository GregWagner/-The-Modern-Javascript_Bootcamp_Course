Big Challenges
1) Fetch data about movies
    Need to search for list of movies that match a search term
    Need to lookup a specific movie and get the needed details
    Use omdbapi.com API
2) Build the autocomplete widget from scratch
    Need list of rules of how the autocomplete works
3) Styling + css

Autocomplete Widget Design
  Default State
    Empty input
  User starts typing...
  User finishes typing and we find no results
    Hide menu
  User finishes typing and we find matching movies
    Show menu, display results
    User presses enter
      Do nothing (require user to click on the movie they want)
    User clicks and entry
      Update text, close menu
    User clicks outside the dropdown
      Close menu

Debounce
1) Everytime a keypress occurs a search is made
2) Instead we want to wait until the user is done tying before
   doing the search.
   * Can use a JS library
   * Can write our own debounce

To Reuse the Autocomplete
1) Update fetchData to the URL and change to the required params
   and update the return
2) Update renderOption() to indicate how (and what) to render:w
